Spiritualized Super GameBoy - 8:7 Aspect Ratio

Everything Super GB Should be supported by this core, including playing real cartridges through the cartridge slot!

To use this core, two files need to be placed into the /assets/sgb/Spiritualized.SuperGB/ folder:

sgb_boot.bin - the 256 byte boot ROM for the GB CPU
sgb_snes.smc - the 256K or 512K BIOS for the SNES

You can use either SGB or SGB2 files.

To run real cartridges, select "run_cartridge.gb" for the game, which is included in this package.

Up to 4 players are supported using the dock.

Enjoy!

Note: The video.json file of this core has been modified from it's original to change the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 8:7. This provides a more full screen experience on the Pocket.
