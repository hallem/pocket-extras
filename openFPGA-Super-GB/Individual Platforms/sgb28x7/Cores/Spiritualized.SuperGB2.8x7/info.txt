Everything Super GB Should be supported by this core, including playing real cartridges through the cartridge slot!

To use this core, two files need to be placed into the /assets/sgb/Spiritualized.SuperGB2/ folder:

sgb_boot.bin - the 256 byte boot ROM for the GB CPU

To run real cartridges, select "run_cartridge.gb" for the game, which is included in this package.

Up to 4 players are supported using the dock.

Enjoy!
