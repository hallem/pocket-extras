Spiritualized Super GameBoy 2

Everything Super GB Should be supported by this core, including playing real cartridges through the cartridge slot!

To use this core, two files need to be placed into the /assets/sgb/Spiritualized.SuperGB2/ folder:

sgb_boot.bin - the 256 byte boot ROM for the GB CPU
sgb2_snes.smc - the 256K or 512K BIOS for the SNES

To run real cartridges, select "run_cartridge.gb" for the game, which is included in this package.

Up to 4 players are supported using the dock.

Enjoy!

Note:
The data.json file of this core has been modified from it's original to change name of the SMC file to distinguish it for the Super GameBoy 2 ROM.

The core.json file was also updated to change the platform_id, shortname, and description to match.
